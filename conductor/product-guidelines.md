# Product Guidelines: ruttu-dictation

## Design Philosophy
*   **Minimalism & Invisibility:** The application should feel native to macOS. It resides in the menu bar and stays out of the way until needed. The UI should be clean, using system fonts and standard macOS controls.
*   **Speed & Responsiveness:** Every interaction, from clicking the icon to seeing transcribed text, must be immediate. Visual feedback for "listening" and "processing" states should be subtle but clear.
*   **Focus on Content:** The user's focus should remain on their document or input field. The app should not steal focus or pop up unnecessary windows.

## Visual Identity
*   **Iconography:** Use a clear, distinguishable icon for the menu bar that changes state (e.g., Gray for idle, Red for recording, Pulsing for processing).
*   **Color Palette:** Adhere to macOS system colors (Dark Mode and Light Mode compatible). Use a distinct accent color (e.g., a professional blue or teal) for active elements in the settings window.
*   **Typography:** San Francisco (System Font) to match the native OS environment.

## User Experience (UX) Principles
*   **Zero-Friction Entry:** Starting dictation should require at most one global hotkey or one click.
*   **Transparent Feedback:** Users should always know if the microphone is hot.
*   **Forgiving:** The system should handle pauses and background noise gracefully without producing garbage text.
*   **Customizable:** Power users should be able to tweak behavior (e.g., voice commands, language) without navigating deep menus.

## Tone of Voice
*   **Professional & Efficient:** The interface text should be concise, direct, and helpful. Avoid jargon where possible, but use precise terms for technical settings (e.g., "VAD Sensitivity").
